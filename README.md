# Radar-simulation
Simulates random points within a selected area to simulate a radar on a website front end.

This was made to test a Raspberry Pi radar with a website as a display that would run on another device. That was going to be a built for a project. 

This works by running the python script on a local server and having it generate random data points (the Raspberry Pi). These then get sent to a website frontend (the display)through a javascript
that then plots these points of data within a set div to immitate the Raspberry pi getting data from a microwave radar module.
